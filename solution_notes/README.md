### 1. Primitive Types
- 4.1: XOR property: association, the XOR of the group of bits is its parity
- *4.2: the expression r & (x - 1) clears the lowest set bit in x, and x & -(x - 1) extracts the lowest set bit of r
- 4.3: shift the result to the left, get the last bit of the input, then or the 0 with the last bit

### 2. Arrays
- 5.1: Quick Sort Partition: use left and right index, run for loop
- 5.2: Array Clock, trace through the number by the second to last number reverse, then check the last number.
- *5.3: Note that python has the max memory size for integer, thus, we will to use 2 for loop
