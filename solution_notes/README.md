### 1. Primitive Types
- 4.1: XOR property: association, the XOR of the group of bits is its parity
- 4.2: the expression r & (x - 1) clears the lowest set bit in x, and x & -(x - 1) extracts the lowest set bit of r
- 4.3: shift the result to the left, get the last bit of the input, then or the 0 with the last bit

### 2. Arrays
- 5.1: Quick Sort Partition: use left and right index, run for loop
- 5.2: Array Clock, trace through the number by the second to last number reverse, then check the last number.
- *5.3: Note that python has the max memory size for integer, thus, we will to use 2 for loop

### 3. Strings
- 6.1: Interconvert string and integer
- *6.2: Base Conversion: Hvae a helper function that convert string to digit and vice versa. Convert the string base b1 to decimal by multiplication and addition. Convert the decimal to string base b2 by mod and floor division. 
- *6.3: spreadsheet_encoding: Get the unicode of a letter then minus 64 to get 1, 2, 3,...

### 4. Linked Lists
- *7.1: merge_sorted_lists: create a dummy_node then append accordingly, remember to move the tail node.
- *7.2: reverse_sublist: Move to the node prior to start
  - The algorithm for swapping sublist is that choose the start node as sublist_iter. You are trying to push the sublist iter to the end while move the temp (sublist_iter.next) to the front of the sublist.
