# Important Concepts in Arrays
- Retreaving and updating A[i] takes O(1) time.
- Insertionn into a full array can be handled by resizing (allocating a new array with additional memory and copying over the entries from the original array).
- The time complexity to delete the element at index i from an array length n is O(n-i).
- Array Libraries:
  - Arrays in Python are procided by the list type. 
  - The key property of a list is that it is dynamically-resized, ie, there is no bound as to how many values can be added to it. In the same way, values can be delted and inserted at arbitrary location.
